# Side Image Preview
A simple and light plugin for displaying images when hovered over thumbnail. This plugin has been developed for a specific project which uses bootstrap. Since it's cointainer is in absolute position and a certain number of z-levels above the rest of the page, a simple plugin which would display the hovering picture would just display it behind. This plugin solves that problem.
Also, this plugin makes every hovering picture to apear on the left of the thumbnail and contained inside the parent's div.

Credit also goes to Alen Grakalic (http://cssglobe.com) from whose plugin a part of the code was used. His code makes possible to use captions underneat pictures and to move the hovered picture as the mouse moves. If anyone is interested, you can find more information about that code here: http://cssglobe.com/post/1695/easiest-tooltip-and-image-preview-using-jquery
